        <h1>Brief history of Benguet</h1>
        <p>
          In 1572, the spaniard general Juan de Salcedo first ventured into the
          mountain of Benguet in search of the gold and copper that were said to
          be coming from the highland region. So from then on, for half a
          century, expeditions were dispatched in an attempt to subjugate the
          lands, gold, and people of Benguet. However, in 1664, the fierce and
          relentless resistance of the Benguet people made the Spanish rulers
          decide to withdraw attempts at subjugation as well as the pursuit of
          their land’s gold.
        </p>
        <p>
          The people of Benguet remained free and independent, but it didn't
          last when, in 1782, the decree of the tobacco monopoly was issued. The
          decision of the then Spaniard Gov. Gen. Jose Blanco to send punitive
          expeditions into areas illegally producing tobacco, clearly since
          igorots are the lucrative producers and traders of tobacco, as well as
          reports of raids of the mountain people on the lowlands as well as the
          flight of fugitives to the mountain areas, caught more attention of
          the Spanish colonizers. So, punitive expeditions into the Benguet
          lands were then organized from 1829 to 1833, led by Commandante
          Guillermo Galvey, which resulted in the burning of villages and
          settlements.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1852, in an effort to map out the mountain territories and contain
          the illegal trade of tobacco, the “Pais de Igorrotes y Partidas del
          Norte Pangasinan” was established. This was later divided into four
          military districts: Benguet, Yamcayan, Abra, and Ifugao. Later on,
          their Spanish government organized the mountain region into six
          commandancias, politico militar, namely: Benguet (1846), Lepanto
          (1852), Bonico (1859), Amburayan (1889), Kayapa (1891), and Kabugao
          (1891). This commandacias was divided into rancherias.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 1899, the Katipunan came to Benguet, united the Igorots, and
          established Benguet under the government of the Republic of the
          Philippines. Juan Oraa “Ahino” Carino of Tublay was appointed governor
          of Benguet and chairman of the board.
        </p>
        <p>
          On August 13, 1908, under Act 1876, Mountain Province was created,
          consolidating the then province of Benguet, the Commandancia of
          Quiangan, the sub-province of Kalinga and Apayao, the province of
          Lepanto-Bontoc, and the sub-province of Amburayan. Benguet became a
          sub-province of Mountain Province, headed by a deputy governor. So,
          Benguet remained a sub-province of Mountain Province with the other
          sub-provinces of Bontoc, Ifugao, and Kalinga-Apayao from 1920 to 1966.
          As of June 18, 1966, under Republic Act No. 4695, Mt. Province was
          divided into provinces, namely Benguet, Mt. Province, Kalinga-Apayo,
          and Ifugao. Thus, Benguet province consists of Atok, Bakun, Bokod,
          Buguias, Itogon, Kabayan, Kapangan, Kibungan, Tublay, Mankayan,
          Sablan, Tuba, and La Trinidad, where it is their capital.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, Benguet, together with Mt. Province, Abra, and
          Kalinga-Apayao, was later separated as provinces, which used to be
          under Region 1 together with Ifugao under Region 2, and has later
          compromised the Cordillera Administrative Region or CAR, by virtue of
          Executive Order 220.

        <h2>The tribes of Benguet:</h2>
        <p>
          <b>1. Ibaloi:</b> The Ibaloi or also known as Nabaloi is an indigenous
          ethnic group found in the northern Philippines. The “ibaloi” is
          derived from the term “ipaway” used by the kalanguyas, that means
          “those who live in the grasslands.”. The Ibalois occupy the
          southeastern two-thirds of Benguet, particularly the municipalities of
          Kabayan, Bokod, Sablan, Tublay, La Trinidad, Tuba and Itogon, and the
          southern portions of Kapangan and Atok (CSG 2003). In the Ibaloi
          mythology, it is said that their origin came from a couple in mt.
          Pulog who survived the great flood that was sent by kabunian, a god in
          their beliefs, to punish the wicked people. This couple gave birth to
          many children who intermarried, multiplied and came to live in the
          fertile valleys of Benguet, including Tinek, that became the ancestors
          of today’s Ibalois. culture and traditions:
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>2. Kankana-ey:</b> There are two Kankanaey groups: Most of the
          northern Kankanaey are located in the southwestern part of Mountain
          Province and inhabit the municipalities of Besao, Sagada, Tadian,
          Bauko, and Sabangan. The southern Kankanaey are found in the
          municipalities of Mankayan, Bakun, Kibungan, Buguias, and the upper
          half of Kapangan in Benguet. The Kankanaey in Benguet may also be
          called Benguet Kankanaey to distinguish them from the Benguet Ibaloi,
          who inhabit the lower half and the most urbanized parts of the
          province, including the vegetable-growing valley of La Trinidad and
          the melting-pot city of Baguio. The Kankanaey has the same
          mythological beliefs with the Ibaloi but with different methods of
          performance a
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>3. Kalanguya:</b> The Kalanguyas are a small ethno-linguistic
          group, found in The Philippines, geographically distributed in the
          mountainous parts of the provinces of Benguet, Pangasinan, Nueva
          Ecija, Quirino, Ifugao and Nueva Vizcaya. Majority of this group lives
          in Nueva Vizcaya, with Kapaya as the center where most people reside.
          The Kalanguyas are also called Ikalahan, Kalanggutan, Keley’I,
          Mandek’ey and Yatukka (Aguilar 1982). Their name is derived from the
          cloud or oak-dominated mountain forest (kalasan); Kadasan, as people
          living in the kalasan (Russell 1992).
