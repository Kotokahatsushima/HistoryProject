          The Ibaloi or also known as Nabaloi is an indigenous ethnic group found in the northern Philippines. The
          “ibaloi” is derived from the term “ipaway” used by the kalanguyas, that means “those who live in the
          grasslands.”. The Ibalois occupy the southeastern two-thirds of Benguet, particularly the municipalities of
          Kabayan, Bokod, Sablan, Tublay, La Trinidad, Tuba and Itogon, and the southern portions of Kapangan and Atok
          (CSG 2003). In the Ibaloi mythology, it is said that their origin came from a couple in mt. Pulog who survived
          the great flood that was sent by kabunian, a god in their beliefs, to punish the wicked people. This couple
          gave birth to many children who intermarried, multiplied and came to live in the fertile valleys of Benguet,
          including Tinek, that became the ancestors of today’s Ibalois. culture and traditions:

          <li>There are two Kankanaey groups: Most of the northern Kankanaey are located in the southwestern part of
            Mountain Province and inhabit the municipalities of Besao, Sagada, Tadian, Bauko, and Sabangan. The southern
            Kankanaey are found in the municipalities of Mankayan, Bakun, Kibungan, Buguias, and the upper half of
            Kapangan in Benguet. The Kankanaey in Benguet may also be called Benguet Kankanaey to distinguish them from
            the Benguet Ibaloi, who inhabit the lower half and the most urbanized parts of the province, including the
            vegetable-growing valley of La Trinidad and the melting-pot city of Baguio. The Kankanaey has the same
            mythological beliefs with the Ibaloi but with different methods of performance</li>

          <li>The Kalanguyas are a small ethno-linguistic group, found in The Philippines, geographically distributed in
            the mountainous parts of the provinces of Benguet, Pangasinan, Nueva Ecija, Quirino, Ifugao and Nueva
            Vizcaya. Majority of this group lives in Nueva Vizcaya, with Kapaya as the center where most people reside.
            The Kalanguyas are also called Ikalahan, Kalanggutan, Keley’I, Mandek’ey and Yatukka (Aguilar 1982). Their
            name is derived from the cloud or oak-dominated mountain forest (kalasan); Kadasan, as people living in the
            kalasan (Russell 1992).</li>
