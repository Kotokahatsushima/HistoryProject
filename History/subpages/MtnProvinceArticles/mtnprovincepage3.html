            The Etag Festival, celebrated by the Bontoc people in Mountain Province, Philippines, is a vibrant cultural
            event deeply rooted in the community's agricultural traditions. This annual festival revolves around the
            ritualistic curing and communal sharing of etag, a traditional salted and cured meat. The festival serves as
            a joyful expression of gratitude for a successful harvest, fostering unity among the community.
            During the Etag Festival, locals gather to showcase their culinary skills in preparing etag, which is often
            made from smoked and salted pork or beef. The curing process, a traditional preservation method, not only
            ensures a stable food supply during lean months but also highlights the sustainable agricultural practices
            of the Bontoc people. Through dances, ceremonies, and shared meals, the Etag Festival stands as a testament
            to the deep cultural connection between the Bontoc community and the bountiful landscapes that sustain them.

            all orchestrated to express gratitude for past agricultural yields and to seek divine guidance for the
            forthcoming cycles. The Kankanaey people, with reverence and devotion, partake in the Solkong Ritual,
            fostering a profound connection between their spiritual beliefs and the agricultural practices that sustain
            their communities. As the rhythmic dances echo through the mountains, and offerings are made to the gods of
            the harvest, the Solkong Ritual encapsulates the essence of Kankanaey identity, celebrating the intricate
            relationship between the people and the land that nourishes them.
