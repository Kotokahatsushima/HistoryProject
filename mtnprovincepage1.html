            The Mountain Province, situated in the Cordillera Administrative Region of the Philippines, boasts a compelling history that echoes the resilience of its indigenous communities. Prior to the Spanish colonization, the region was inhabited by various ethnic groups, prominently the Bontoc and the Kankanaey. The rugged terrain of the Cordilleras played a crucial role in preserving the autonomy of these communities.

            Spanish influence gradually seeped into the region during the colonial era, marked by attempts to incorporate the Cordillera territories into the Spanish administrative system. The introduction of the encomienda system aimed to control and Christianize the indigenous population, but the mountainous landscape and the staunch resistance of the locals limited Spanish influence.
            
            The American colonial period saw the Mountain Province established as a distinct political entity in 1908, covering a larger area than it does today. The province was further divided into sub-provinces, each with its unique cultural identity. During this time, the indigenous peoples of the Mountain Province continued to resist external control, preserving their cultural practices and social structures.
            
            Over the years, administrative adjustments led to the formation of the present-day Mountain Province, officially re-established on June 18, 1966. Today, the province stands as a testament to the rich cultural heritage of the Igorot people, with vibrant traditions, indigenous rituals, and a captivating landscape that continues to attract visitors eager to explore its natural beauty and cultural wonders. The history of the Mountain Province is a narrative of resilience, cultural preservation, and the enduring spirit of its people amidst the changing tides of history.
        </p>
        <h1>People of Mt.Province</h1>
        <p>

            Nestled within the towering peaks of the Cordillera mountain range, the people of the Mountain Province have crafted a unique tapestry of history that echoes through the ages. Long before the arrival of foreign colonizers, indigenous communities such as the Bontoc and Kankanaey thrived in these rugged terrains, cultivating distinct languages, customs, and social structures.

            During the Spanish colonial era, the Mountain Province witnessed resistance to external influence, with the indigenous people fiercely defending their autonomy and cultural practices. The Americans, following the Spanish, encountered resilient communities that persisted in preserving their way of life amidst changing tides.
            
            The amalgamation of various indigenous groups under the Mountain Province's administrative umbrella in 1908 marked a pivotal moment in the region's history. Despite administrative changes, the people continued to nurture their unique cultural identities, maintaining traditional practices and passing down ancestral wisdom through generations.
            
            Throughout the years, the Mountain Province has been a cradle of resistance, resilience, and cultural pride. Today, the descendants of these indigenous communities proudly carry the mantle of their ancestors, with a cultural heritage that stands as a testament to their enduring spirit in the face of historical challenges. The Mountain Province people's journey is an odyssey of cultural preservation, a narrative etched into the very heart of the Cordilleran highlands.
        </p>
        <h1>Culture</h1>
        <p>
            The culture of the Mountain Province is a living testament to the resilience and vibrancy of its indigenous communities. Rooted in the mist-covered peaks of the Cordillera mountain range, the cultural heritage of the province has weathered centuries, embodying a captivating narrative of traditions, rituals, and societal intricacies.

            The indigenous groups, including the Bontoc and Kankanaey, have cultivated a rich tapestry of customs that define their way of life. Language, a cornerstone of cultural identity, resonates with distinct dialects that weave through daily conversations, stories, and songs. The Bontoc and Kankanaey, among other ethnic communities, proudly pass down their linguistic heritage, ensuring its preservation for future generations.
            
            Ceremonies and rituals play a pivotal role in the Mountain Province's cultural landscape. Whether it be the intricate celebrations marking harvests, the solemnity of communal gatherings, or the poignant rites associated with life passages, each ritual is a thread that binds the community together and reinforces the bonds with their ancestral spirits.
            
            The region's artistic expression is reflected in traditional crafts, including intricate handwoven textiles, woodcarvings, and basketry. These crafts not only serve utilitarian purposes but also convey a deep connection to nature, mythology, and the everyday life of the indigenous peoples.
            
            The Mountain Province's cultural narrative also encompasses a harmonious relationship with the environment. The agricultural practices, particularly the famed rice terraces, are not just feats of engineering but manifestations of a sustainable way of life that has endured for generations.
            
            Despite encounters with external forces, such as Spanish and American colonialism, the Mountain Province's culture has persisted, adapting without losing its essence. Today, the cultural landscape continues to evolve, embracing elements of modernity while safeguarding the authenticity of its traditions. The Mountain Province's cultural odyssey is a story of endurance, adaptation, and the ever-evolving expression of the unique spirit that resides within the heart of the Cordilleras.

          In 1899, the Katipunan came to Benguet, united the Igorots, and
          established Benguet under the government of the Republic of the
          Philippines. Juan Oraa “Ahino” Carino of Tublay was appointed governor
          of Benguet and chairman of the board.
        </p>
        <p>
          On August 13, 1908, under Act 1876, Mountain Province was created,
          consolidating the then province of Benguet, the Commandancia of
          Quiangan, the sub-province of Kalinga and Apayao, the province of
          Lepanto-Bontoc, and the sub-province of Amburayan. Benguet became a
          sub-province of Mountain Province, headed by a deputy governor. So,
          Benguet remained a sub-province of Mountain Province with the other
          sub-provinces of Bontoc, Ifugao, and Kalinga-Apayao from 1920 to 1966.
          As of June 18, 1966, under Republic Act No. 4695, Mt. Province was
          divided into provinces, namely Benguet, Mt. Province, Kalinga-Apayo,
          and Ifugao. Thus, Benguet province consists of Atok, Bakun, Bokod,
          Buguias, Itogon, Kabayan, Kapangan, Kibungan, Tublay, Mankayan,
          Sablan, Tuba, and La Trinidad, where it is their capital.
